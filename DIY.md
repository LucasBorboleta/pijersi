# How to Do It Yourself


## Drawings
This [pictures/svg-kit](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/pijersi/tree/master/pictures/svg-kit) folder provides you with vectorial drawings in SVG format for the cubes and the board (with and without labels). Other files from the [pictures](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/pijersi/tree/master/pictures) folder might also be convenient.

## Sizes
- Recommended cube size : either 2 cm or 1.6 cm.
- Recommended cell size on the board : 2 times the cube size.

## Making the board
### Option 1 
- Print the board picture on a A3 format paper. 
- Optionally cut the printed paper and just keep the hexagons. 
- Glue the paper on a wooden board. 
- Stack heavy books a few hours.
### Option 2
- Print the board picture on a A3 format paper. 
- Position the paper above a wooden board and temporary fix it using adhesive. 
- Use a nail and a hammer to mark the hexagons vertices's. 
- Remove the paper. 
- Draw the hexagons using a felt according to the marked vertices. 
- Apply varnishes in hexagons in two colors.
## Making the cubes
### Option 1
- Print the square faces of the cubes on a "strong paper" ("cartonnette" in French). 
- Ensure the size of the printed square is 1 millimeter smaller or so than the size of the cube. 
- Cut all square faces and glue them on the cubes. 
- Then apply a transparent varnish.
### Option 2
- Draw the shapes using a felt pen with the help of a drawing template ruler. 
- Since white felt pen is merely "white paint pen" which tends to get erased, an alternate option is to replace black cubes by red cubes and to mark their faces using a black felt pen.
